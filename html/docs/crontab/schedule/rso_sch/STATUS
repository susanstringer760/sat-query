Adding the Rapid Scan sectors has been completed.  The add_rso_sch script finds matches to the files
we have on mass store to the scheduled scans during periods of rapid scan.

This should be done similarly for the Super Rapid Scan!!  Having some issues with the goes-8 schedule.

The ext_sch2.pl script pulls the scans from the goes08_srso.htm and goes10_srso.htm files and will
place them into the database.  This needs to be updated to deal with the 1-minute scans.

UPDATE: the Super raid scan was added, but I'm not sure how - some things are just magic. :)
