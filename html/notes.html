<font size=4><p>Since 1999 NCAR has operated GOES-East and and GOES-West direct broadcast ground stations. A third
system was used to collect data at remote locations in the field between 1999-2002. Data from the remote system
can be found in the project archives here at EOL. These 3 systems were purchased from Seaspace Corp. and collect
data using Terascan software. This archive contains imager data files in Terascan Data Format (TDF). As far as
we know, you must have Terascan software to read these files. Other GOES archives exist for other formats, most
notably McIDAS AREA file format. The NOAA Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) is a good place to 
start: <a href=http://www.class.ncdc.noaa.gov>http://www.class.ncdc.noaa.gov</a>.
This archive began in July 1999 and continues to this day. 

<p>This website allows the users to view the contents of the archive by date, 
satellite, resolution and scan sector. Data can be ordered when vieing the individual file list for a date by 
clicking the checkbox for that sector under the "Data Retrieval" column. Some rows will be highlighted to indicate
non-routine scanning. Yellow indicates Rapid-Scan operations in progress, while Red indicates Super-Rapid Scan 
operations. When data gaps exist larger than approximately 1 hr, they are denoted by a yellow bar labeled 
"???Missing Data???". Reasons for missing data include systems maintenance as well as unscheduled downtimes and 
eclipse and Keep Out Zone operations. 

<p>All GOES satellite imaging and sounding instruments undergo eclipse operations in the spring and fall to avoid
draining on-board batteries while the satellites pass through the earth's shadow. There is also significant risk
of sunlight entering the scanners as the spacecraft enters and exits the shadow. This part of eclipse 
operations is known as the Keep Out Zone. The time period where data is
lost due to eclipse and Keep Out Zone operations is usually only a few hours in the middle of the night 
(depending on the spacecraft longitude). Eclipse schedules can be found at:
